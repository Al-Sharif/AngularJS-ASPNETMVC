# AngularJS-ASPNETMVC
Getting started with AngularJS and ASP.Net MVC5

1. Create new MVC Project with Individual Authentication.
2. Perform this commands respectivley:
  
    Uninstall-Package Microsoft.jQuery.Unobtrusive.Validation
    Uninstall-Package jQuery.Validation
    Uninstall-Package jQuery
    Uninstall-Package Modernizr
    Uninstall-Package Respond
    Uninstall-Package bootstrap

*It seems as though we just deleted everything, why didn't we use the blank template?

Visual Studio added all of the correct libraries/boilerplate code we need for authentication etc when we selected this template. Deleting the unnecessary html/javascript was a lot faster than using the blank template and adding everything needed for authentication.
